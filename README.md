# VaultOfCode_internship
A neatly structured repository showcasing my work for VaultOfCodes Java Internship. This week focused on strengthening Java fundamentals, improving code quality, and building conceptual clarity through hands-on tasks.
📘 VaultOfCodes Internship – Week 1
📄 Brief Overview This repository contains my completed work for Week 1 of the VaultOfCodes Java Internship. The week focused on improving Java fundamentals through hands-on error correction and conceptual understanding.
The work is divided into Task 1 and Task 2.
🟦 Task 1 – Java Code Review & Error Correction In this task, I analyzed 8 beginner-level Java code snippets, identified syntax and logical errors, corrected them, and added short explanations. ✔ Concepts strengthened: Java syntax rules Variable declaration & initialization Data types and type safety Arrays and valid indexing Loops (for, while) and control flow Methods (static vs non-static) Common compile-time and runtime errors This task helped reinforce the fundamentals needed for writing clean, error-free Java code.
🟩 Task 2 – Java Presentation I created a short presentation covering essential Java topics: 📌 Covered in the presentation: Introduction to Java History and evolution of the Java language Key OOP Concepts: Encapsulation Inheritance Polymorphism Abstraction This task helped build a conceptual foundation and understand why Java remains a popular, secure, and platform-independent programming language. 👨‍💻 Intern Details 🔹 Name: Chiranjivi R 🔹 Email: chiranjivir23is@rnsit.ac.in
